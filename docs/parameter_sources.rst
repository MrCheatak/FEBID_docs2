Temperature dependence
=======================

Residence time
"""""""""""""""

The heating and temperature tracking serves for the definition of temperature dependent time at runtime.
The dependence is *Arrhenius*-like and is described by the following relation:

:math:`\tau=\frac{1}{k_0}exp\left( \frac{E_a}{k_B T} \right)`

where:
    :math:`k_0` is the exponential prefactor representing desorption attempt frequency [Hz]

    :math:`E_a` is the adsorption energy [meV]

    :math:`k_b` is the Bolzman constant

    :math:`T` is temperature [K]
