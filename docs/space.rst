Simulation space
=================

Space discretization:
"""""""""""""""""""""


Define the space:
""""""""""""""""""

Substrate:
    Substrate serves as a support for the grown structure and indicates the base of the simulation cahmber.
    Substrate thickness or height should be chosen based on three considerations:

    #. It must be thicker than secondary electron bean free path

    #. It must be at least 2 cells high regardless of cell size
