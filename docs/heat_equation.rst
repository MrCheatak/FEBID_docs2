Heat equation solution
=======================================

Both heat distribution and diffusion are described via a parabolic PDE equation and thus
require a numerical solution.

Although, the processes are similar in nature, they occur at characteristic time steps differing by orders of magnitude.
This fact implies usage of different numerical solution for th heat transfer problem.

In the actual version of the package, the default for heat transfer is SOR.
The methods are described in detail in the PDE section and here we briefly overview the solutions for each problem.

Heat equation can be solved via a type of finite difference methods â€“ the *implicit Euler* method.

The heat equation:

:math:`c_p\rho\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=k\nabla^2T+q`,

which is resolved in 3D space:

:math:`c_p\rho\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=
k\left(\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial z^2}\right)+q`

where:
    :math:`c_p` is the heat capacity of the solid medium :math:`\left[ \frac{J}{kg\cdot K} \right ]`

    :math:`\rho` is the density :math:`\left[ \frac{kg}{nm^3} \right ]`

    :math:`k` is thermal conductance :math:`\left[ \frac{W}{nm\cdot K} \right ]`

    :math:`q` is the heating source originating from electron beam heating :math:`\left[ \frac{J}{nm^3} \right ]`

    :math:`T` is temperature [K]

Due to the fact, that heat transfer characteristic time step is orders of magnitude shorter than one of mass transport
(diffusion), the solution of heat equation requires an accordingly shorter time step. Such fine time discretization
would make the simulation orders of magnitude slower.

Although, the same feature of the heat transfer means that evolution of an equilibrium or `steady state` occurs
almost instantly. It means that time discretization is neglected and the problem simplifies to a calculation
of a steady state:

:math:`k\nabla^2T=-q`

The problem of deriving a steady state is called a relaxation problem and is solved by a family of relaxation methods.
Here it is solved via a `Simultaeous Over-Relaxation` (SOR) method. Generally, it represents an FTCS scheme, ultimately
applied with the maximum stable time step. The main prerequisition for the SOR method is convergence of the solution.
The convergence is evaluated based on a norm of the difference between current and previous iterations. When the norm
diminishes below a certain value that is called `solution accuracy` the convergence is reached.

Due to the slow rise of temperature caused by beam heating, a steady state profile can be derived
at a significantly lower rate than the diffusion equation is solved.

Effectively, re-calculation of the steady state temperature profile is necessary approximately 10 times per deposition
time second for the PtC deposit.
